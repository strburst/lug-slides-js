      # [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History)

      - Created for Netscape Navigator in 1995

      ???
      - Realized just server-side scripting is not enough
      - We need a "glue" language

      --
      - First prototype created in 10 days by Brendan Eich

      ???
      - Brendan Eich originally hired to implement scheme
        - Then it was decided it needed to be familiar to Java programmers and complement Java
      - Named JavaScript because of Java hype at the time

      --
      - Javascript standardization suffered a lot during the browser wars
        - E.g. failed ES4 standard

      ???
      ECMAScript is just a name for standardized Javascript

      --
      - All browsers finally on board in 2009 when ES5 was published
        - Standardization has been getting better since then

      --
      - Javascript has been changing a lot since ES6/ES2015

      ---

      # Brendan Eich: "Sorry"

      > I talk a lot about being in a hurry, which was very true; I didn't sleep much. I did the prototype for Javascript in ten days. But really, I'd already read SICP and I'd studied Scheme, and I have no good excuse for some of these things.

      - Javascript: The Good Parts

      ???

      - I don't think I'll be as thorough as some of these crash courses
        - I will try to sample some interesting language topics instead
        - Exercise in programming language linguistics
      - Feel free to interject at any time for clarifications
        - I'll even take requests for particular language features I should cover

      # [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)

      ```
      var presentation = {
        date: Date.now(),
        topic: 'Javascript',
        'delete me': 'hello', // keys are arbitrary strings
        hello: function() { // methods are just properties assigned to functions
          return 'Hello, world!';
        },
        presenter: 'Allen', // trailing commas are allowed
      };
      ```

      ???
      - Really easy to make objects (one of the good parts)
      - Objects are basically just key-value pairs
      - You might not believe me, but JSON is valid Javascript (there are some edge cases with numbers)
      - Most things in Javascript are objects (objects, arrays, functions), but not numbers

      --

      ```
      presentation.presenter; // 'Allen'

      // . and [] notation are equivalent for literals without special characters
      presentation.organization = 'LUG@GT';
      presentation['organization'] = 'LUG@GT';

      // key can be an arbitrary expression
      var top = 'top';
      presentation[top + 'ic']; // 'Javascript'
      ```

      ???
      Dot vs. array notation

      --

      ```
      del presentation['delete me'];
      presentation['delete me']; // undefined
      ```

      ---
      name: proto-title

      # [Prototypal inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance)

      --

      - Objects get layered on top of one another in a "prototype chain"
      - If we can't find a key in an object, we look in its prototype

      ```
      // Hackish way
      var proto = { a: 'hello', b: 'world' };
      var o = { a: 'hi' };
      Object.setPrototypeOf(o, proto);

      o.a; // 'hi'
      o.b; // 'world'
      ```

      ???
      - Objects without classes
        - Original Prototypal language was Self
        - Lua is the other modeern programming language to have this via metatables
      - If you want to create an object from a template, you can use another object
      - Setting the prototype after the fact is very slow

      - This is hackish because we're setting the prototype after object creation

      --

      ```
      proto.b = 'everyone'
      o.b; // 'everyone'
      ```

      --

      ```
      // To make this more of a hack, we could set __proto__ directly
      // __proto__ is not a standard!
      o.__proto__ = proto
      ```

      ---
      template: proto-title

      - Objects inherit from Object.prototype

      ```
      ({}).toString(); // "[object Object]"

      Object.prototype.hello = function() {
        return 'Hello, world!';
      };

      ({}).hello(); // 'Hello, world!'
      ```

      ???
      - Default `toString` gives the 'type' of Object
      - Object literals inherit from Object.prototype by default
      - Setting properties on Object is called monkey-patching, and is frowned upon

      --

      ```
      var noProto = Object.create(null);
      noProto.toString();
      // TypeError: noProto.toString is not a function
      ```

      ???
      You can create an Object with no prototype with Object.create

      ---
      template: proto-title

      ```
      function Animal(name) { // Can set properties in constructor
        this.name = name;
      }

      // Or add to the special prototype object directly
      Animal.prototype = {
        corporeal: true,

        makeNoise: function() {
          return '...';
        },
      };
      ```

      ???
      By convention, constructors are capitalized, however, there's nothing special about this

      When 'new' is used, 'this' will be bound to a new object
      --

      ```
      function Dog(name) {
        Animal.call(this, name);
      }

      Dog.prototype = new Animal(); // Set up the prototype chain
      Dog.prototype.makeNoise = function() {
        return 'Bork!';
      };
      ```

      ???
      Call exists on all functions

      What if we defined the method in the constructor?
      ---
      template: proto-title

      - Typical Dog inherits from Animal relationship

      ```
      var doggo = new Dog('Gabe');
      doggo.corporeal; // true
      doggo.makeNoise(); // 'Bork!'

      Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(doggo); // true
      doggo.__proto__ === Dog.prototype; // true

      Animal.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);
      doggo.__proto__.__proto__ === Animal.prototype; // true
      ```

      ---
      template: proto-title

      - Less hackish way to set proto directly

      ```
      var proto = { a: 'hello', b: 'world' };

      var obj = Object.create(proto, {
        a: {
          writable: true,
          configurable: true,
          value: 'hi',
        }
      });
      ```

      ---

      # Concurrency

      - Asynchronous, nonblocking, i.e. *single-threaded*
        - JS was made for the browser
        - JS is event-driven
            - Executing Javascript is somewhere in the event loop
            - Events like clicking the mouse/typing trigger Javascript
        - (Not 100% true in the browser due to web workers)
      --
        - If Javascript stops, your app stops too!
            - Everything that can block is made asynchronous
      --
      - No need to think about preemption/interleaving
        - If something happens, it has to wait in a queue

      ???
      event driven

      ```

      ???
      - We're exploiting first-class functions again

      --

      <button id="myBtn">Click me</button>

      ```
      document.getElementById('myBtn').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        alert('Click event at (' + event.clientX + ',' + event.clientY + ')');
      });

      - But how do I do all the stuff I learned about in CS 2200 with pthreads?
        - Do `n` things in sequence
        - Do `n` things concurrently and come back when you did all of them
        - Do `n` things concurrently and come back with the first result, ignoring the rest

      ---

          setTimeout(function() {

            setTimeout(function() {
              console.log('are');
              setTimeout(function() {
                console.log('you');
              }, 600);
            }, 700);
          }, 800);
        }, 900);

          // Remember, preemption won't hurt us, so no mutexes
          semaphore += 1;
          if (counter >= NUM_PARALLEL) {
            thingToDoAtTheEnd();
          }

      --

      (Probably) wise words:

      > Hating on JavaScript is lame - for a language that was invented and implemented in 2 weeks, by a single guy, with ridiculous additional "requirements" shoved down his throat at gunpoint, it gets an astonishing amount of things right. Mistakes were made, sure, but at least there is a handful of unifying ideas there, and they aren't half bad.
      > Hating on PHP, however, *is* fun...

      What's going on?
      - We are getting special values like undefined
      - Then we are coercing them to strings and indexing into them to get characters
      - Then we are concatenating some code together and evaling it

      Please no questions!

      - Javascript is the only language that has *function-scope*
      --


      ```
      (function() {
        if (true) {
          var x = 12;
        }
        return x;
      })(); // 12

      x; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
      ```

      - This is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
      - All the programming languages you know and love probably have lexical scoping

      --
      ```
      (function() {
        if (false) {
          var x = 12;
        }
        return x;
      })(); // undefined

      x; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
      ```

      - What really happened

      ```
      (function() {
        var x;
        if (false) {
          x = 12;
        }
        return x
      })(); // undefined

      x // ReferenceError: x is not defined
      ```

      ???
      - `var` declaration hoiseted to the top of the function

      - ES2015 adds lexical scoping with `let` and `const` keywords
      --


      ```
      (function() {
        if (true) {
          let x = 12;
        }
        return x; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
      })();
      ```

      template: scope-let-const
        - `const` does not allow reassignment

      ```
      let x = 12;
      x += 1;

      const y = 12;
      y += 1; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
      ```

      # [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

      - New syntax for function literals

      ```
      (param1, param2, ...) => { code }
      (param1, param2, ...) => value
      ```

      --

      - Advantage: much shorter

      ```
      [1, 2, 3].map(function(elem) {
        return elem * 2;
      }); // [2, 4, 6]

      [1, 2, 3].map(e => e * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
      ```

      --

      - There are also some optimizations like fixing `this` and not setting the `arguments` object, but I don't feel like explaining it

      # Stuff I didn't talk about

      - Javascript tooling/npm
      - node.js
      - Tons of language features/quirks
      - Tons of ES2015 features
      - Optimization/optimization killers
