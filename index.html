      # History

      - Created for Netscape Navigator in 1995

      --

      - First prototype created in 10 days by Brendan Eich

      --

      - Javascript standardization suffered a lot during the browser wars

      --

      - Finally, came ECMAScript Harmony in 2008

      ???

      Brendan Eich originally hired to implement scheme, but then they decided it needed to complement be familiar to Java programmers
      Mocha -> LiveScript -> JavaScript
      Candidates: Python, Scheme

      ---

      # Brendan Eich: "Sorry"

      > I talk a lot about being in a hurry, which was very true; I didn't sleep much. I did the prototype for Javascript in ten days. But really, I'd already read SICP and I'd studied Scheme, and I have no good excuse for some of these things.

      -- Brendan Eich, [2010](https://youtu.be/1EyRscXrehw?t=5m8s)

      Brief talk about weirdness in Javascript: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat

      --

      (Probably) wise words:

      > Hating on JavaScript is lame - for a language that was invented and implemented in 2 weeks, by a single guy, with ridiculous additional "requirements" shoved down his throat at gunpoint, it gets an astonishing amount of things right. Mistakes were made, sure, but at least there is a handful of unifying ideas there, and they aren't half bad.
      > Hating on PHP, however, *is* fun...

      - Try it yourself: http://www.jsfuck.com/
        - Express `['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((e) => alert(e))` in 59897 characters!

      # Fun facts

      - ["Semicolons in Javascript are optional"](http://mislav.net/2010/05/semicolons/)
        - "automatic semicolon insertion"

      --

      ```
      function f() {
        return // ;
        {
          an: 'object',
        }
      }

      function g() {
        return // ;
          a + b
      }
      ```

      ---
      template: fun-title

      ```
      // lines that begin with '('...
      a = b + c
      (d + e).prop()

      // ...will be joined with the previous line
      a = b + c(d + e).prop();
      ```

      ???
      Semicolons are not required despite C-like syntax
      There are a few gotchas to be aware of
      Strictly speaking, this makes Javascript whitepsace sensetive

      Not widely used because Douglass Crockford said so
