      I'm your presenter; it's my first time presenting to the LUG
      Who here is comfortable with Javascript?

      Why you should care about Javascript

      ???

      Originally going to talk about *just* node.js, then js + node.js, then just js
      Maybe a future talk

      So much optimization work was done in V8 that JS is really fast

      # History

      - Created for Netscape Navigator in 1995

      --
      - First prototype created in 10 days by Brendan Eich

      --
      - Javascript standardization suffered a lot during the browser wars

      --
      - Finally, came ECMAScript Harmony in 2008

      ???

      Brendan Eich originally hired to implement scheme, but then they decided it needed to complement be familiar to Java programmers
      Mocha -> LiveScript -> JavaScript
      Candidates: Python, Scheme

      ECMAScript is just a name for standardized Javascript

      ---

      # Brendan Eich: "Sorry"

      > I talk a lot about being in a hurry, which was very true; I didn't sleep much. I did the prototype for Javascript in ten days. But really, I'd already read SICP and I'd studied Scheme, and I have no good excuse for some of these things.

      -- Brendan Eich, [2010](https://youtu.be/1EyRscXrehw?t=5m8s)

      Not going to be a comprehensive language tutorial
      Will cover the bare minimum to understand things
      I will cover more interesting stuff instead
      Exercise in programming language linguistics

      # Objects

      ```
      var presentation = {
        date: Date.now(),
        topic: 'Javascript',
        'delete me': 'hello', // keys are arbitrary strings
        hello: function() { // methods are just properties assigned to functions
          return 'Hello, world!';
        },
        presenter: 'Allen', // trailing commas are allowed
      };
      ```

      ???
      Really easy to make objects (one of the good parts)
      Objects are basically just key-value pairs

      --

      ```
      // . and [] notation are equivalent for literals without special characters
      presentation.organization = 'LUG@GT';
      presentation['organization'] = 'LUG@GT';

      // key can be a variable
      var key = 'topic';
      presentation[key]; // 'Javascript'
      ```

      --

      ```
      del presentation['delete me'];
      presentation['delete me']; // undefined
      ```

      ---
      name: proto-title

      # Prototypal inheritance

      --

      ```
      // Hackish way (not all implementations)
      var proto = { a: 'hello', b: 'world' }
      var o = { a: 'hi' }
      o.__proto__ = proto

      o.a; // 'hi'
      o.b; // 'world'
      ```

      ---
      template: proto-title

      ```
      function Animal(name) { // Can set properties in constructor
        this.name = name;
      }

      // Or add to prototype directly
      Animal.prototype = {
        corporeal: true,

        makeNoise: function() {
          return '...';
        },
      };
      ```

      --

      ```
      function Dog(name) {
        Animal.call(this, name);
      }

      Dog.prototype = new Animal(); // Set up the prototype chain
      Dog.prototype.makeNoise = function() {
        return 'Bork!';
      };
      ```

      ???
      Objects without classes
      If you want to create an object from a template, you can use another object

      By convention, constructors are capitalized, however, there's nothing special about this
      When 'new' is used, 'this' will be bound to a new object
      Call exists on all functions
      What if we defined the method in the constructor?
      ---

      # Prototypal inheritance

      Typical Dog inherits from Animal relationship

      ```
      var doggo = new Dog('Gabe');
      doggo.corporeal; // true
      doggo.makeNoise(); // 'Bork!'

      doggo.__proto__ === Dog.prototype; // true
      doggo.__proto__.__proto__ === Animal.prototype; // true
      ```

      (Probably) wise words:

      > Hating on JavaScript is lame - for a language that was invented and implemented in 2 weeks, by a single guy, with ridiculous additional "requirements" shoved down his throat at gunpoint, it gets an astonishing amount of things right. Mistakes were made, sure, but at least there is a handful of unifying ideas there, and they aren't half bad.
      > Hating on PHP, however, *is* fun...

      # Fun facts

      - ["Semicolons in Javascript are optional"](http://mislav.net/2010/05/semicolons/)
        - "automatic semicolon insertion"

      --

      ```
      function f() {
        return // ;
        {
          an: 'object',
        }
      }

      function g() {
        return // ;
          a + b
      }
      ```

      ---
      template: fun-title

      ```
      // lines that begin with '('...
      a = b + c
      (d + e).prop()

      // ...will be joined with the previous line
      a = b + c(d + e).prop();
      ```

      ???
      Semicolons are not required despite C-like syntax
      There are a few gotchas to be aware of
      Strictly speaking, this makes Javascript whitepsace sensetive

      Not widely used because Douglass Crockford said so
